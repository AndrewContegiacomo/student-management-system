Student Management System

This program is a simple console-based Student Management System written in C.
It allows users to manage student personal and academic records using file storage.

The system supports adding new students, removing existing ones, updating student information, and displaying all stored student records. Student data such as name, roll number, and grades are saved to a file and can be retrieved and shown on request.

Input validation is implemented to ensure correct data entry, and file handling is managed carefully to prevent data corruption.
